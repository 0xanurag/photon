     #####
     96 customisable functions are available, for varying image effects.
     
    
     
     `photon` can be thought of as a high-level wrapper to the Rust `image` crate, but conversely also includes functions which provide low-level access to pixel and channel manipulation, perfect for developers who wish to work with this data directly.
     
     ### 🧐 Repo Organisation
     This repo can be thought of as a hybrid library, divided into 2 major components:
     1. ***Core Rust library***: This provides universal image processing functions, which can be used either natively or in the browser. The WASM component of this repo relies on this for all image processing functionality. 
     2. ***WebAssembly helpers and starter demo***: This section of the library contains helpers for exporting pixel data to and from the browser, and communicates directly with the core Rust library. The starter demo demonstrates calling the compiled WebAssembly code using JS functions and hooks into a webpack build pipeline. 
     
     ### Live Demo
     View the [official demo of WASM in action](https://silvia-odwyer.github.io/photon).
     
     ### Documentation
     Documentation can be found [here](https://silvia-odwyer.github.io/photon/docs/photon/index.html).
     
     ## Examples
     ![](https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/photon/blob/master/docs/img_examples/streetlamp_collage.png)
     
     ## Live Demo
     The GIF below shows an image cycling through various effects available. Don't take heed of the quality, since this is a GIF and 
     merely for demonstration purposes. You should run the library's binary for a more thorough analysis.
     
     ![](https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/photon/blob/master/docs/img_examples/cube_demo.gif)
     
     ## 🚴Getting Started
     
     These instructions will get you a copy of Photon up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
     
     ### Prerequisites
     
     To use Photon, you must have Rust and Node installed. Builds of Photon are compiled using the rust nightly toolchain.
     
     ### Installing
     <!-- ## Cargo Status -->
     <!-- `photon` can be installed via Cargo by declaring the following dependency in your Cargo.toml file:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     photon-rs = "*"
     ``` -->
     
     Clone this repo:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/photon
     ```
     
     Run the binary, which will perform an image processing function on an image:
     ```sh
     cd crate
     cargo run --release 
     ```
     
     Compare the original image with the outputted image, and you'll see the desired effect has been applied.
     
     ### Native Use
     Photon contains native-only functions for opening files from the filesystem. 
     
     When an image is opened, it is converted to a `PhotonImage` type, which can then be passed into any image processing function, and the `PhotonImage` value is accordingly edited.
     
     Getting started is relatively straightforward, this code snippet is all you need to get started:
     ```rust
     extern crate photon;
     fn main() {
         // Open the image as a PhotonImage type
         let img = photon::helpers::open_image("daisies.JPG");
         
         // Apply a Sobel effect to the image 
         let filtered_img = photon::conv::sobel_vertical(img);
         
         // Write the contents of this image in PNG format.
         photon::helpers::save_image(filtered_img, "new_image.PNG");
     }
     ```
     
     See the documentation for a full list of effects which you can apply. All functions take in a `PhotonImage` similar to above.
     
     ### 🚴 Get Started With WebAssembly 
     
     ##### 🔋 Batteries Included
     
     This repo comes pre-configured with a quick-start demo, which hooks into a Webpack build pipeline, and provides all WASM-friendly functions.
     
     ***WARNING***: Running WASM code in development mode is ***significantly*** slower than in production mode (often up to 10 times),
     so don't be disheartened if the JS alternatives outperform WASM. For the blazing speeds promised, make sure to build the 
     project under production mode with `npm run build` and visit `dist/index.html`. 
     
     * `npm run start` -- Serve the project locally for development at
       `http://localhost:8080`.
     
     * `npm run build` -- Bundle the project (in production mode).
     
     ##### WebAssembly Use
     To allow for universal communication between the core Rust library and WebAssembly, the functions have been generalised to allow for both native and in-browser use. 
     
     Due to this, image data from the browser must first be converted to a PhotonImage before being passed to the image processing functions. 
     
     The PhotonImage can then be converted back to JS-compatible ImageData so that it can be displayed in-browser.
     
     See the code snippet below:
     ```js
     function filterImage(event) {
         var canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
         var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
         
         ctx.drawImage(newimg, 0, 0);
         
         // Get the image data from the image
         let imgData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
     
         // Convert the ImageData to a PhotonImage (so that it can communicate with the core Rust library)
         let rust_image = module.open_image(imgData, canvas.width, canvas.height);
     
         // Filter the image, the PhotonImage's raw pixels are modified and 
         // the PhotonImage is returned
         let new_image = module.filter(rust_image, filter_name);
     
         // Convert the PhotonImage's raw pixels to JS-compatible ImageData
         let new_pixels = module.to_image_data(new_image);
         
         // Place the pixels back on the canvas
         ctx.putImageData(new_pixels, 0, 0);
       }
     ```
     
     Not all functions available in the core Rust library are available in WebAssembly (currently investigating this). Only WASM-friendly functions have been annotated with #[wasm_bindgen]. All supported WASM functions are displayed in the starter demo. 
     
     ## Modules 
     Photon contains a series of modules, which include:
     
     - `effects`: Various image effects, including adding offsets, thresholding, duotoning, solarization, etc.,
     - `channels`: Functions related to increasing/decreasing the red, green, and blue channels of the image data.
     - `filters`: Preset filters, which alter the rgb channels of the image. Contains over 20. 
     - `conv`: Laplace, Sobel, emboss; image proc functions which require image convolution. 
     -  `noise`: Noise generation of varying tints and hues. 
     - `multiple`: A module for dealing with multiple images, such as watermarking images, etc.,
     - `correction`: Hue rotation, adjusting saturation, lightening/darkening: all techniques available in multiple colour spaces, which lead to varying effects.
     
     All effects and filters can be viewed below and on the official website.

     ## Building For Production
     
     #### Native
     You can edit the binary file in the `bin` dir to create an executable or a command-line app, for example. 
     
     Then, to build this executable for native use in release mode:
     
     ```sh
     cd crate 
     cargo build --release
     ```
     
     #### WebAssembly
     To build the example under production mode:
     
     ```sh
     npm run build
     ```
     
     Check the `dist` folder for the outputted static files, which can be deployed to a live server.
